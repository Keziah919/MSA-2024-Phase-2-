I performed data cleaning by removing missing values, converting 'Order Date' to datetime format, and dropping non-contributing columns. Outliers in 'Sales', 'Quantity', and 'Profit' were removed using the IQR method. Numerical columns were standardized using `StandardScaler`. Hierarchical encoding was applied to 'City' and 'State', capturing their relationship, and other categorical columns were encoded using `LabelEncoder`.

Key Finddings:
California leads in total sales, followed by New York and Texas.
Standard Class is the most used, especially in high-sales states like California, Texas, and New York. Same Day shipping is the least used.
Chairs and Furnishings have significant sales in many states, while Tables and Bookcases are more concentrated in fewer states.
The Consumer segment shows the highest sales, especially in California. Corporate and Home Office segments have concentrated sales in states like California and Colorado.
The West region, particularly California, dominates sales, followed by the East and Central regions. The South has lower sales.
Sales peak around the end of the year, with the West region and Standard Class shipping showing consistently higher sales.
Chairs and Tables show significant sales peaks over time, indicating high demand periods. Bookcases and Furnishings also show variability in demand.
